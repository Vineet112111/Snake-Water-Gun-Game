## 💡 My Experience

While working on the background animation and style effects in the CSS file, I ended up experimenting with `background-size`, `background-position`, and gradients for hours. Without realizing, 2 hours had flown by! 😄 But it turned out super exciting, and I'm proud of how the final look came together!
